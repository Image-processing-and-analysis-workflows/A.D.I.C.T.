Welcome to Antibiotic  Drug  screening  and  Image  Characterization Toolbox (A.D.I.C.T.)

Test data is available:

This introduction gives advice, how to use the scripts published in F1000 to reproduce the workflow:

-Please make sure that the folders containing your data (may they be part of your personal research or test data from the paper) is properly stored in respective folders.

-Keep in mind that addressing the correct folders within this workflow is case sensitive, so in case it won't work as it should it could be explained by misspelling.

-This is a combined workflow which can be used differently depending on the task you might want to address as part of your project. This is why the scripts are splitted
 into subscripts to highlight individual steps of the workflow. However, you might find one script more usefull for your purposes as the other, so just keep on trying and
 modifying for your analytical needs. Many crucial code snippets are labelled to explain their usage (in ImageJ macro it starts with "//"). 

-However, feel free to ask questions around this workflow if you are facing any trouble.
